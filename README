much familiar with the online mode of evaluation. There are various platforms 
available for online studies. But there is no such platform available that provides the 
features of marks updating and result generation. 
Following are some of the problems which led to the creation of this website: 
Problem 1: There is no such single platform which provides both functionalities: 
Storing and evaluating the answer sheets and automatic result generation. 
Problem 2: It is very difficult to check the answer sheets by annotating the PDF files 
on desktops or laptops. This task takes a lot of time and patience to check and 
evaluate the answer sheets of hundreds of students. 
Problem 3: There is no such platform that displays detailed exam analysis and 
generates a marksheet for each student.
