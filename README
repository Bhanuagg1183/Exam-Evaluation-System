## 🎯 Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted various aspects of our lives, including healthcare systems, businesses, economies, and education. In these challenging times, online learning has emerged as a crucial solution for students and teachers worldwide, enabling millions to continue their educational journey.

**Exam-Evaluator** has been developed to enhance the online education system by addressing the critical need for efficient exam evaluation and result generation. This software transforms the traditionally time-consuming process of result generation into an easy, efficient, and streamlined experience.

The primary purpose of this system is to make online learning more interactive and smooth while building better communication channels between students and teachers regarding academic evaluation.

## 📖 Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic forced the global education system to shift entirely to digital mode. Educational institutions worldwide now rely on various web conferencing applications to conduct online classes, making digital learning a lifeline for students during these unprecedented times.

While online education has proven invaluable in maintaining educational continuity, there's significant room for improvement in exam evaluation and result generation processes. The traditional approach to online exams—involving document submission and manual evaluation—presents numerous challenges for both educators and students.
